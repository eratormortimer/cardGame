        <h1>Rules</h1>

        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>

        <h3>Cards</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Each card has a unique name.</li>
            <li>There is one <em>Class-card</em> for each
                <em>Class</em>
            <li>Each non-Class-card has an <em>Ability</em>,
                <em>Cast</em> duration, <em>Cooldown</em> duration,
                and an <em>Edition</em></li>
            <li>A card can optionally specify a <em>Class</em></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Deck and Playing Set</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>A Deck cannot contain cards of different
                Editions.</li>
            <li>Each Deck must contain exactly one Class-card.</li>
            <li>A Deck consists of arbitrarily many cards, with
                arbitrary rarities.</li>
            <li>A Deck must not contain Class-specific cards for any
                class other than the one specified by the class
                card.</li>
            <li>A Playing Set is a subset of the Deck.</li>
            <li>A Playing Set consists of at most ten cards, including
                the Class-card.</li>
            <li>There can be an unlimited number of Common cards,
                three Rare cards, two UltraRare cards, and one
                Legendary in the Playing Set.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Before starting the game, teams of players are
                fixed.</li>
            <li>After fixing the teams, each player places his or her
                Class-card open-faced on the board.</li>
            <li>Once all Class-cards are on the board, each player can
                choose nine cards from his or her Deck. Those will be
                the player's Playing Set.</li>
            <li>The Playing Set is only visible for the respective
                player.</li>
            <li>A random player starts the game.</li>
            <li>The order of turns is arbitrary but fixed.</li>
            <li>Each player starts with 100 <em>Lifepoints</em></li>
            <li>Each team's aim is to decrease all opponents'
                Lifepoints to 0.</li>
            <li>A player plays at most one card each turn. No other
                actions can be performed.</li>
            <li>If a player plays a card whose Cast duration is
                greater than 0, the player must wait that many turns
                before the card takes effect---that card is in the
                <em>Casting </em> state.</li>
            <li>A player can only play a card if none of his or her
                cards is in the Casting state.
            <li>When playing a card, the player must place the card
                open-faced on the board and read its Ability out
                loud.</li>
            <li>If a card has taken effect whose Cooldown duration is
                greater than 0, the card must stay open-faced on the
                board for that many turns.</li>
            <li>A player can only play cards which are in his or her
                hand.</li>
        </ol>
