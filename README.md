## Basic Rules

### Cards 

1. Each card has a unique name.
2. There is one *Class*-card for each *Class*.
3. Each non-Class-card has an *Ability*, *Cast* Duration, *Cooldown* and an *Edition*.
4. A card can optionally specify a *Class*.

### Deck and Playing Set

1. A Deck cannot contain cards of different Editions.
2. Each Deck must contain exactly one Class-card.
3. A Deck consists of arbitrarily many cards, with arbitrary rarities.
4. A Deck must not contain Class-specific cards for any class other than the one specified by the class card.
5. A Playing Set is a subset of the Deck.
6. A Playing Set consists of at most ten cards, including the Class-card.
7. There can be an unlimited number of Common cards, three Rare cards, two UltraRare cards, and one Legendary in the Playing Set.

### Gameplay

1. Before starting the game, teams of players are fixed.
2. After fixing the teams, each player places his or her Class-card open-faced on the board.
3. Once all Class-cards are on the board, each player can choose nine cards from his or her Deck. Those will be the player's Playing Set.
4. The Playing Set is only visible for the respective player.
5. A random player starts the game.
6. The order of turns is arbitrary but fixed.
7. Each player starts with 100 Lifepoints.
8. Each team's aim is to decrease all opponents' Lifepoints to 0.
9. A player plays at most one card each turn. No other actions can be performed.
10. If a player plays a card whose Cast duration is greater than 0, the player must wait that many turns before the card takes effect---that card is in the Casting state.
11. A player can only play a card if none of his or her cards is in the Casting state.
12. When playing a card, the player must place the card open-faced on the board and read its Ability out loud.
13. If a card has taken effect whose Cooldown duration is greater than 0, the card must stay open-faced on the board for that many turns.
14. A player can only play cards which are in his or her hand.
